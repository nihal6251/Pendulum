# Pendulum

A concise, friendly project for simulating and exploring simple pendulum dynamics.

Pendulum is a small, focused project for simulating and visualizing simple pendulum motion. It provides clear, easy-to-follow code to experiment with oscillations, damping, and parameter tuning — useful for learning, teaching, and quick prototyping.

If you'd like, I can expand this README with installation instructions, examples, or language-specific run steps. Please tell me which files or languages you'd like me to reference.
